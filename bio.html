            <span id="hiddenBio" style="display: none;">   
            <p class="a">Born into a family of musicians, artists, and scientists, Benjamin was immersed in a rich cultural and creative environment from an early age. His early education in music was multifaceted, encompassing studies in classical piano, voice, and violin. Later, he pursued further education in church music, organ, and jazz piano. As a boy soprano soloist with the Vienna Boys Choir, he had the opportunity to perform at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and participate in renowned events such as the Salzburg Festival under the direction of Riccardo Muti. He also worked with esteemed conductors like Seiji Ozawa and Philippe Jordan during his early musical career. These formative experiences not only honed his musical skills but also exposed him to high-caliber performances and a wide range of musical traditions.</p>
            <p class="a">Benjamin’s professional journey is marked by versatility. As a bass-baritone, he has sung Renaissance music under the guidance of early music guru René Clemencic and performed Gregorian chants with the Choral Schola of the Vienna Hofburg Chapel. His role with several ensembles, including New Opera Vienna under the direction of Walter Kobéra, showcased his adaptability and range as a vocalist. Additionally, he explored diverse genres as the lead singer, keyboardist, and arranger for both a progressive metal band and an award-winning boogie-woogie band. These bands provided a platform for Benjamin to tour extensively, performing at festivals and venues across Europe and reaching audiences as far as India. </p>
            <p class="a">In his recent projects, Benjamin's work spans compositions, music productions, film scores, and sound art installations. His dedication to exploring new directions in contemporary music is reflected in his varied contributions to film and theater projects, electro-acoustic and computer music compositions, and music production for his solo project "Cubed²" and under the pseudonym "Captain Candy II" for "Isabella Sky." </p>
            <p class="a">Benjamin grew up in Japan and has lived in Italy and the USA, and is currently based in Graz, Austria. This multicultural background enriches his compositions, drawing from the diverse soundscapes and musical traditions he has experienced around the world. The rich tapestry of his life experiences fuels his creative vision, emphasizing the power of diversity in shaping innovative and compelling musical narratives. </p>
