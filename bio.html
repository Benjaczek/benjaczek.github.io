            <h1>BIO</h1>
            <p class="a" id="shortBio">Benjamin Alan Kubaczek, an Austrian-American composer, multi-instrumentalist, and sound artist, studies computer music and sound art with Daniel Mayer at the Institute for Electronic Music (IEM) in Graz, Austria, and acousmatic composition with Annette Vande Gorne in Vienna. His compositions have recently been presented at events including a vernissage in Leipzig, Germany, the New York City Electronic Music Festival (NYCEMF) in the USA, and alongside a short film at the MCM Festival International Music & Cinema in Marseille.  </p>
            <span id="hiddenBio" style="display: none;">   
            <p class="a">In his recent projects, Benjamin's work spans compositions, music productions, film scores, and sound art installations, reflecting his dedication to exploring new directions in contemporary music. His contributions include a variety of film and theater projects, electro-acoustic and computer music compositions, and music production for his solo project "Cubed²" as well as under the pseudonym "Captain Candy II" for "Isabella Sky." </p>
            <p class="a">A highlight of Benjamin's early musical career was his role as a boy soprano soloist with the Vienna Boys Choir, where he performed at renowned venues, including Carnegie Hall. He further honed his craft by singing Renaissance motets under René Clemencic and performing in the Salzburg Festival under the direction of Riccardo Muti. </p>
            <p class="a">Transitioning into adulthood, Benjamins musical repertoire expanded significantly. He performed as a bass-baritone with several ensembles, including New Opera Vienna, under the direction of Walter Kobéra. Additionally, he explored diverse genres as the lead singer, keyboardist, and arranger for both a progressive metal band and an award-winning boogie-woogie band. </p>
            <p class="a">Benjamin's musical education is extensive, encompassing studies in jazz piano, organ, and church music, alongside masterclasses in Acousmatic composition, orchestra, and choir conducting across Austria, Germany, and Estonia. His performances with prominent choirs such as the Vienna Chamber Choir, Chorus Viennensis, Vienna Singakademie, and the Choral Schola of the Vienna Hofburg, have been led by esteemed conductors like Seiji Ozawa and Philipp Jordan. </p>
            <p class="a">Currently, Benjamin is deeply involved in film music and sound art, where he innovatively uses sensors and electronics to manipulate soundscapes. His fascination with the expressive potential of acousmatic music composition drives his creative process. Looking forward, he aims to integrate this knowledge into upcoming projects, with a keen focus on film and multimedia, exploring the intersection of sound, technology, and visual narratives.</p>
            <p class="a">As a member of a family of musicians, artists, and scientists, Benjamin grew up in Tokyo, Japan, and has lived in both Austria and Italy, as well as the USA. He leverages his rich multicultural background and the vast spectrum of sounds he has experienced around the world as a foundation for his compositions and music productions.</p>
