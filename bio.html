            <p>The Austrian-American composer, multi-instrumentalist, and sound artist Benjamin Alan Kubaczek is currently studying computer music and sound art with Daniel Mayer at the Institute for Electronic Music (IEM) of the University of Music and Performing Arts in Graz, Austria. Starting September 2023, he will study Acousmatic Composition with Annette Vande Gorne in Vienna, Austria. Most recently, his compositions were heard in Leipzig, Germany, at the vernissage "Lexikon in 4 Stücken" and at the New York City Electronic Music Festival (NYCEMF) in New York, USA. He brings a broad range of musical experiences and knowledge into his work. As a boy soprano, he performed at the Salzburg Festival under Riccardo Muti and recorded Renaissance motets with Vienna's late guru of early music, René Clemencic. He has sung as a bass-baritone with the New Opera Vienna under the direction of Walter Kobéra and was the lead singer, keyboardist, and arranger of a progressive metal band as well as an award-winning boogie-woogie band. He has performed at numerous national and international music festivals, including Frequency (AT), Master of Puppets (CZ), Burning Mountain (SUI), IIT Rendevouz Festival (IND), and more. He has studied jazz piano, organ, and church music, attended Acousmatic masterclasses with Jaime Reis and Annette Vande Gorne, and has also attended masterclasses in orchestra and choir conducting in Austria, Germany, and Estonia. He has performed and recorded with many renowned choirs, including the Vienna Chamber Choir, Chorus Viennensis, Vienna Singakademie, and the Choral Schola of the Vienna Hofburg, under world-famous conductors such as Seiji Ozawa and Philipp Jordan. He has also been involved in various projects with artists like Winfried Ritsch, Gerry Weil, and Paul Brody. As a composer and music producer, he has worked on numerous film and theater projects, writes electro-acoustic and computer music, and produces music for his solo project "Cubed²" and under his pseudonym "Captain Candy" for "Isabella Sky".
As a member of a family of musicians, artists, and scientists, Benjamin grew up in Tokyo, Japan, and has lived in both Austria and Italy, as well as the USA. He leverages his rich multicultural background and the vast spectrum of sounds he has experienced around the world as a foundation for his compositions and music productions.</p>
